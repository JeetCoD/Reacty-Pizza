## About The Project

This repository contains a simple starter project built using React. It introduces beginners to various React concepts such as props, fragments, short-circuiting, and more. The project showcases a menu for a fictional pizza restaurant, allowing users to view available pizzas and place orders.

## Built With

This project was built using the following technologies and tools:

React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
ReactDOM - A package that provides DOM-specific methods for React.
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets for styling the application.
The project follows modern best practices in React development and utilizes concepts such as props, fragments, short-circuiting, and component composition. It also leverages the React ecosystem for efficient rendering and managing the application state.

Popular tools like npm and yarn facilitate the project setup and build process, enabling easy dependency management and development workflow.
